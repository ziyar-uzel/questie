# Meeting Notes

- General Feedback
    - Work distribution improved (still a bit uneven)
    - Most MR don’t really have many comments. We should add comments for peer reviews (live feedback, presenting code)
    - Test coverage: Still a little low. It will get checked by TA. This might be due to the lack of shared folders between client/server.
    - MRs are looking good
    - Commit messages are a little unclear.
- General Progress
    - Looks alright, improve the GUI
    - Improve on test coverage
- Checkstyle tests
    - Just change the settings scope
- Test coverage
    - Run coverage with shield (make sure to confirm it is running all tests)
    - Add service class tests
    - Focus mainly on server tests. Client testing is not a priority.
    - Coverage is calculated by the lines of code the tests visit
- Presentation video
    - Pre-recorded video
    - Or present the draft live
- Design Document feedback
    - Adjust the wireframes, or show the actual app in the appendix. There should be visual comparisons. (important part of the rubric)
    - Lack of documentation → Too general. Specify it, be explicitly, things that you can immediately fix.
    - Problem frequency: THis problem was found by one person.
    - Issue prioritization: Mainly on the issues you want to implement. List the problems, and prioritize. Take the list, and talk about the top 5 issues (severity, easily fixable)
