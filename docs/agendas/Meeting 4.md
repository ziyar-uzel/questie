# Meeting Notes

- TA Feedback
    - Merge to master by the end of every spring (increment)
    - Branch names must be related to the issues (names after issue number and name)
    - Contribute to the code
    - Some MR are a bit too broad
- Design Document Questions
    - Is there a template/ example design document?
    - Feedback will be provided later.
- Responsible CS
    - What does non-obvious stakeholder mean? Is it going to be one of the eight stakeholders we identified in 1) or a completely different one? Are we free in choosing any value we want to explore? Should all of the assignment be focused on that value and stakeholder combination?
- HCI Assignment
    - Do we need to work with another group (for the draft)?
    - Can Renats pair us with a group?
    - What exactly are we going to evaluate
    - Will we use the same heuristics as presented in the lecture?
    - Surveys are a good idea but don’t waste too much time
    - Find one other group to collab with, and review each other’s designs/templates
    - Feedback on UI, usability
- Backend architecture + API routes
    - Confirmed 
    - REST Api usage
    - Screenshot and add to docs folder in repository
- Issue distribution + working in parallel
    - Go through user story
    - Separate issues as much as possible e.g. client and server
    - Small issues that are really descriptive
- Database H2 and PSQL
    - Dedicated DB is one approach
