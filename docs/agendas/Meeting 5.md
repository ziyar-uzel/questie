# Meeting Notes
- Test coverage at 4%: take it up to 60% at least
    - (basic unit tests, followed by server/controller/service tests, lastly client tests but only a few)
    - It’s easier to test service classes, but harder to test controllers. If you test the service classes and entities, you don’t need to test controllers.
- Merge requests too broad
- Broad issues and commits
- Focus on balancing git contribution
- Code architecture is fine
